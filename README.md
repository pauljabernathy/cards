This is just a toy project I started to simulate Texas Hold'em deals, to see what the probabilities of various hands are and see if I could write a simulator that agrees with theoretical predictions.  For simplicity's sake, it deals seven cards each deal.  Other numbers are possible but the hand ranking class only recognizes poker rankings.  
It has enums for Suit and Ranks, a Card class, a Deck class, classes for sorting, a class to rank the hards, and a class to run the simulation.  The simulation consists of dealing a specified number of hands (with a clean deck each time) and recording the results.  At the end, the results are tallied.  So nothing is very algorithmically complex.  Random number generation is done by a random number generator I wrote many years ago.

Currently, the percentages given for large simulations (10,000 deals and up) agree fairly well with the theoretical values given on Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands, but a few are off by ~1-2%, presumably due to a known issue with detecting straight flushes.
